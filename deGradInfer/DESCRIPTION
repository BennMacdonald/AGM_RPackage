Description: This package performs efficient Bayesian parameter inference 
    for systems of ordinary differential equations. The inference is based
    on adaptive gradient matching (AGM, Dondelinger et al. 2013, MacDonald 
    2017), which offers orders-of-magnitude improvements in computational 
    efficiency over standard methods that require solving the differential 
    equation system. Features of the package include flexible specification 
    of custom ODE systems as R functions, support for missing variables,
    Bayesian inference via population MCMC.
