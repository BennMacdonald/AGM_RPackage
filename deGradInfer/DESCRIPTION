Description: Efficient Bayesian parameter inference for systems of ordinary 
    differential equations. The inference is based on adaptive gradient matching 
    (AGM, Dondelinger et al. 2013 <http://proceedings.mlr.press/v31/dondelinger13a.pdf>, 
    Macdonald 2017 <http://theses.gla.ac.uk/7987/1/2017macdonaldphd.pdf>), 
    which offers orders-of-magnitude improvements in computational 
    efficiency over standard methods that require solving the differential 
    equation system. Features of the package include flexible specification 
    of custom ODE systems as R functions, support for missing variables,
    Bayesian inference via population MCMC.
